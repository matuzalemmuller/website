# **About Me**

<br>

I am a DevOps engineer with 6+ years of experience and a recent MSc in Automation/Systems Engineering graduate from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. I have consistently met performance goals, and I am adept at achieving maximum operational output with minimal resource expenditure. Professional focal points include networking, service deployment, process improvement, requirements definition, user testing, quality assurance, technical support, roadmap development, project management, and cross-functional collaboration.

Currently, I am a DevOps Engineer at ElephantDrive. In this role, I streamline the software development, testing, and release lifecycle through efficient requirements definition, continuous client relations, and collaboration with strategic partners. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership, project stakeholders, and internal teams to ensure that the companyâ€™s development support structure is driving each project forward with minimal expenditures.

Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver the intended results.

I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field. Feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matuzalemmuller) or [Keybase](https://www.keybase.io/matuzalemmuller).

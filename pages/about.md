# **About Me**

<br>

I started my career by facilitating international contract negotiations and providing insights about the Brazilian tech market to a US-based company. After a few months of working on implementing a project in Brazil, I switched roles to provide customer support Levels 1 and 2 in the same country. After succeeding in that role, I also started working on Level 2 support for customers worldwide.

As my daily tasks became more technical, I was also introduced to the Quality Assurance team and started working on manual and automated testing. My daily work on customer support and QA allowed me to gain a better understanding of product development, which led me to join the product team to collaborate on designing the development roadmap and cycles.

Along with working in customer support, product development, and testing, I also assist developers and engineers by maintaining a remote infrastructure and keeping an eye on the cloud computing environments.

Professionally, I have been a Jack of all trades for over 4 years and am now specializing in cloud environments and DevOps. Academically, I majored in telecommunications engineering with emphasis on cloud computing. I also studied abroad in the US thanks to a fully-funded scholarship provided by the Brazilian government, and am currently finishing my masters in Automation and Systems Engineering.

I enjoy programming, computers, servers, and I am always looking for new challenges. My hobbies include traveling, cooking, reading, movies, and programming (honestly :v:).

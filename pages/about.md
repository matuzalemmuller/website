# **About Me**

<br>

I started my career by facilitating International contract negotiations and providing insight on the Brazilian tech market. After a few months of working on implementing a project in Brazil, I switched roles to provide customer support Levels 1 and 2 in Brazil. After succeeding at that role, I also started working on Level 2 support for customers worldwide.

As my daily tasks became more technical, I was also introduced to the Quality Assurance team and started working on manual and automated testing. My daily work on customer support and QA allowed me to gain a better understanding of product development, which led me to join the product team to collaborate on designing the development roadmap and development cycles.

Along with working on customer support, product development, and testing teams, I also provide assistance to developers and engineers by maintaining a remote infrastructure and keeping an eye on the cloud environments.

Professionally, I have been a Jack of all trades for over 4 years and am now specializing on cloud environments and DevOps. I enjoy programming, computers, servers, and am always looking for new challenges.

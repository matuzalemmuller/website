# **About Me**

<br>

I am a Systems Engineer with 7+ years of experience and a recent MSc in Automation/Systems Engineering graduate from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. I have consistently met performance goals, and I am adept at achieving maximum operational output with minimal resource expenditure. Professional focal points include networking, service deployment, process improvement, requirements definition, user testing, quality assurance, technical support, roadmap development, project management, and cross-functional collaboration.

Currently, I am an Associate Systems Engineer at SIG. Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver the intended results.

I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field. Feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matuzalemmuller) or [Keybase](https://www.keybase.io/matuzalemmuller).

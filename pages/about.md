# **About Me**

<br>

I have been in the tech industry for over six years. During that time, I have worked in technical support (levels 1 & 2), contract negotiations, product management, quality assurance, and currently, DevOps & cloud environments.

I have worn many hats over the years. Working with multiple departments has helped me learn about various aspects of the tech industry and understand how communication is vital for a distributed team. As a result, I am always looking for ways to increase the team's cooperation and productivity to deliver a better solution to stakeholders.

I am genuinely interested in solving problems and learning about technology in general. I like to solve problems ranging from embedded systems to cloud computing. During my master's thesis, I developed an [open source framework to program embedded agents](https://embedded-bdi.github.io/), and since I graduated, I have been seeking AWS and cloud-related knowledge and certifications. I am also an advocate for FOSS and enjoy working on personal projects during my spare time.

My current study topics/day-to-day tech stack include Python, Docker, GitLab, Terraform, and AWS.

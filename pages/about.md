# **About Me**

<br>

I have always been curious about how things work. When young, I would disassemble toys to understand how they work and then (hopefully) put them back together. Following this passion, I went to college for an engineering degree and quickly fell in love with all technology-related topics.

II started my career by facilitating international contract negotiations and providing insights about the Brazilian tech market to a US-based company. After a few months of working on implementing a project in Brazil, I switched roles to provide customer support Level 2 for customers worldwide. I quickly started collaborating with multiple departments, working on manual and automated testing, providing insight on the product roadmap, managing AWS cloud resources, and maintaining local and cloud servers.

I have been a Jack of all trades for over 6 years and am specializing in cloud environments and DevOps. My daily tasks include setting up and maintaining pipelines in GitLab, watching servers using Grafana, troubleshooting issues using Kibana, managing AWS infrastructure using Terraform, and providing guidance to other team members in various fields (as I have been involved with multiple departments for a long time).

I enjoy programming, computers, servers, and I am always looking for new challenges. My hobbies include solving puzzles, eating out, and reading. Other interests include Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Linux.
